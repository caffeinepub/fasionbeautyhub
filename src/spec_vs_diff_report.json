  "summary": "Changes ensure the theme defaults to \"light\" on fresh visits (including pre-hydration) and still persists user-selected theme via localStorage. However, there is no evidence in the diff that homepage components were audited/updated to remove hard-coded dark/black background classes, nor that all main homepage sections are guaranteed to avoid black/near-black backgrounds in the default theme.",

      "id": "REQ-15",
      "requirement": "Audit and remove/replace any hard-coded dark/black background classes in homepage components so that light mode consistently uses Tailwind theme tokens (e.g., bg-background, bg-card, muted variants) rather than black/dark colors.",
      "reason": "The diff only modifies theme initialization/state management and does not show any edits to homepage components (Header, Hero, Categories, Trending, Newsletter, Footer) to remove/replace hard-coded black/dark background utilities.",

      "requirement": "The top-level page background and all main sections (Header, Hero, Categories, Trending, Newsletter, Footer) do not render with a black/near-black background in the default theme.",
      "reason": "While theme defaulting to light is implemented, the diff provides no component/style changes demonstrating that the homepage sections/background classes themselves are not hard-coded to black/near-black when in light/default mode.",
